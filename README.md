A Few Notes
===========

**What's TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a language that allows you to write in a statically-typed language that outputs standard JavaScript.
It's all kinds of awesome.

**Why should I use it?**
This will be especially helpful for an OS or a Compiler that may need to run in the browser as you will have all of the great benefits of strong type checking and scope rules built right into your language.

**Where can I get more info on TypeScript**
